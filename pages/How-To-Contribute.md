# Making Your Contributions & Continued Participation

## How Do I Participate?
Now that you have been formally inducted into the Supernova program, you have access to a multitude of resources and opportunities. The [Discussions tab](https://github.com/Kcorb95/Postman-Supernova-Program-Resources/discussions) on this page serves as our primary method of communication. In addition to that, you should have access to the official Postman Slack channel where we often post additional opportunities that are under NDA and cannot be shared publicly within this page.
Both of these places are the best way to keep up to date with current events, opportunities and other things happening within the community.

## Continued Participation
To remain in the program, we require regular event participation or content contributions. This means one event (speaking/hosting) or two content contributions per-quarter. Contributions should be of equal effort to one another, meaning a longer and more involved content contribution could eliminate the need to make a second contribution.

### Types of Contributions
- Speaking at an open event.
- Organizing/hosting an open event.
- Creating written content.
- Creating video/live content.
- Postman early access feedback.
- [Quickstarts contributions](https://youtu.be/aLehVZegyXk).

## Planning Your Contribution
To propose a contribution, [open a new issue](https://github.com/Kcorb95/Postman-Supernova-Program-Resources/issues/new?assignees=Kcorb95&labels=Contribution+Proposal&template=contribution-proposal.md&title=Contribution+Proposal+-+TITLE+%28Supernova+Name%29). This helps us support you and schedule marketing promotions. After contributing, remember to fill out the post-contribution report (see below).

## Submitting Your Contributions
In order to get credit for your contributions, increase your exposure and remain in the program, you will need to [submit your contribution report](https://airtable.com/shrM6Uh7WqOEJJQZ7) after each event/contribution. Additionally, contributions must be both shared on social media and the Postman community forums.
