# Making Your Contributions & Continued Participation

## How do I participate?
Now that you have been formally inducted into the Supernova program, you have access to the official Postman Slack channel which serves as our primary method of communication. Slack is the best way to keep up to date with current events, opportunities and other things happening. There is also a special section of the Postman community forums for Supernovas and an official [Twitter community](https://twitter.com/i/communities/1529542918717022209).

## Continued Participation
To remain in the program, we require regular event participation or content contributions, approximately one event (speaking/hosting) or two content contributions per-quarter.

### Types of Contributions
- Speaking at an open event.
- Organizing/hosting an open event.
- Creating written content.
- Creating video/live content.
- Postman early access feedback.
