# Making Your Contributions & Continued Participation

## How Do I Participate?
Now that you have been formally inducted into the Supernova program, you have access to the official Postman Slack channel which serves as one of our primary methods of communication. Second to that is the [Discussions tab](https://github.com/Kcorb95/Postman-Supernova-Program-Resources/discussions) on this page. Both of these places are the best way to keep up to date with current events, opportunities and other things happening within the community.

## Continued Participation
To remain in the program, we require regular event participation or content contributions, approximately one event (speaking/hosting) or two content contributions per-quarter.

### Types of Contributions
- Speaking at an open event.
- Organizing/hosting an open event.
- Creating written content.
- Creating video/live content.
- Postman early access feedback.
- [Quickstarts contributions](https://youtu.be/aLehVZegyXk).

## Planning Your Contribution
If you're thinking of contributing an event, a piece of content or one of the other above accepted contribution types, please [open a new issue](https://github.com/Kcorb95/Postman-Supernova-Program-Resources/issues/new?assignees=Kcorb95&labels=Contribution+Proposal&template=contribution-proposal.md&title=Contribution+Proposal+-+TITLE+%28Supernova+Name%29) to detail your plans so that we may help enable you to do the best that you can and schedule marketing to help promote. Note that this is NOT the contribution report that you will have to fill out via the section below *after* your event.

## Submitting Your Contributions
In order to get credit for your contributions, increase your exposure and remain in the program, you will need to [submit your contribution report](https://airtable.com/shrM6Uh7WqOEJJQZ7) after each event/contribution. Additionally, contributions must be both shared on social media and the Postman community forums.
