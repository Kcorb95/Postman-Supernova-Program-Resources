## Event Sponsorship
As a Supernova, you can request Postman to assist in sponsoring an API-related meetup/event once per quarter. You must be involved in the meetup group as either a speaker, an organizer or both. The meetup group must have existed for at least two months or two events, whichever happens first. Additionally, the meetup must be tech-related and address API use or API development. See more information about receiving sponsorship here.
