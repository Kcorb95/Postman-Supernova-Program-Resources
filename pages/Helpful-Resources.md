## Event Sponsorship
As a Supernova, you can request that Postman assist in sponsoring an API-related meetup once per quarter. You must be involved in the meetup group as either a speaker, an organizer or both. The meetup group must have existed for at least two months or two events, whichever happens first. Additionally, the meetup must be tech-related and address API use or API development. See more information about receiving sponsorship [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rW8tCwkAemoj94m4KXIj57RNfa3lB1Rl/view).
