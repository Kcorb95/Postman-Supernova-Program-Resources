## Contribution Best Practices

### Target Audience
- It is essential to understand your target audience's interests, pain points, skill level and background in order to create content that resonates with them. 
- Valuable content is content that educates, entertains, or informs an audience.
- Ensure that your content is unique, relevant, and engaging.

### Promoting Your Contribution & SEO
- Use relevant keywords for search engine optimization (SEO).
- Opt for simple titles that people would already be searching for, "How to do X in Postman" instead of "Legendary API testing skills using Postman".

### Social Media
- Promote contributions on platforms like Twitter, LinkedIn, DEV, Medium, Reddit, Facebook, TikTok, etc to help build a following and get eyes on your work.
- Track metrics (website traffic, social media engagement, click-through rates) to measure success and improve content.

### Making the Most of Your Contribution
- Create complementary content (e.g., videos with blog posts, videos and livestreams to accompany events).
- All pieces of content can be shared multiple times in multiple ways. Even a handful of pictures of a crowd at your event/talk can help you grow your community.

### Improving Written Content
- Use simple, clear language and avoid jargon.
- Organize content into sections with clear headings.
- Include visuals like diagrams, tables, and charts.
- Keep content concise and to the point.
- Use tools like [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com) or peer reviews for proofreading.
- Be consistent with terminology and formatting.
- Use [active voice](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/active-vs-passive-voice/) whenever possible.
- Avoid calling things "simple" or "easy" -- these are subjective and can alienate beginners who might not find the subject matter to be simple.

### Improving Video Content
- Good audio and proper, bright lighting are the two most important things to have.
- Avoid laptop microphones and background noise.
- Keep microphone a proper (close) distance from your mouth to improve volume and reduce background sounds.
- Use tools like [NVIDIA Broadcast](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/broadcasting/broadcast-app/) to improve audio and video quality.
- Adjust zoom levels to make small text easily readible and consider using scripts to make content more engaging, informative, and easy-to-follow.
- Edit your footage to remove unnecessary parts, adjust brightness/contrast if necessary, and add transitions and other things to keep your footage snappy and engaging.

## Creating Better Assets
- First impressions are crucial for attracting clicks and registrations.
- Use high-quality, simple images with minimal text.
- Ensure images are clear and understandable on small screens.
- Try to remember a simple rule: less is more.
