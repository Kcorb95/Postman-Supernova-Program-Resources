## Contribution Best Practices

### Target Audience
Before creating any content or planning an event, it is essential to understand who your target audience is. Trying to understand their interests and pain points will help you create content that resonates with them. Valuable content is content that educates, entertains, or informs an audience. Ensure that your content is unique, relevant, and engaging.

### Promoting Your Contribution & Search Engine Optimization
Optimizing your content for SEO is also very important. Use relevant keywords in your content to optimize it for search engines. Try to think about what people would be searching to find your content. "How to do X in Postman" is more commonly used than a more complicated title with words that wouldn't be used in search.

### Social Media
Social media platforms are great tools for promoting your contributions and building a following. At Postman we heavily use Twitter and LinkedIn, but there are other options such as DEV, Medium, Reddit, Facebook, TikTok, and more. Measure the success of your content and events by tracking metrics such as website traffic, social media engagement, and click-through rates. Analyze the data to identify what is working and what is not to make changes that improve your content.

### Making the Most of Your Contribution
Try to think of other types of content that can complement your contribution. For example, a video could come with a blog post (and vice versa!) an event could have multiple videos, blog posts, and a livestream all before, during, and after the event. All pieces of content can be shared multiple times in multiple ways across your social media channels. Even a handful of pictures of a crowd at your event/talk can help raise more awareness.

### Improving Written Content
Use simple and clear language. Avoid jargon, complex words, and lengthy sentences. Use plain, straightforward language to make your content easy to understand. Organizing your content into sections and subsections with clear headings will help your readers navigate the content and find the information they need quickly. The use of visuals such as diagrams, tables, and charts to help explain complex concepts will make your content more engaging and easier to follow. Eliminate unnecessary words and phrases to keep your content more concise and to the point.

### Improving Video Content
The two most important things that you can do to have better quality video is to have good audio and proper, bright, lighting. Darker scenes end up looking worse on camera. Good audio is very important to get your message across properly and for building a following. 

Good clean audio means no background noise and a loud enough volume that you can be easily heard. Try to avoid using a laptop microphone as that often picks up typing and clicking. Keeping the microphone close to your mouth helps with volume and reducing background noise such as fans, cars, etc.

Look into tools like [NVIDIA Broadcast](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/broadcasting/broadcast-app/) which uses AI to improve audio and video if you have supported hardware. Ensure you have a proper zoom level so that small text is easily read on mobile devices. Consider going off-script, or likewise, even write a script if you donâ€™t usually use one. Scripts can help you deliver your message more effectively and help you make more engaging, informative, and easy-to-follow content. Be sure to edit your footage to remove unnecessary footage, adjust brightness and contrast if necessary, and add transitions and other things to keep your footage snappy and engaging.

## Creating Better Assets
It's important to keep in mind that first appearances are EVERYTHING when it comes to getting clicks and registrations for your events, videos, and blog posts. High-quality and simple images are very important. Try to remember a simple rule: less is more. Don't try to fill your image with too much text. Try to make it clear and understandable from just a glance on a small screen.
